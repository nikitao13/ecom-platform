# E-Commerce Platform

Welcome to our E-Commerce Platform! This platform is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers and robust management tools for administrators.

## Overview

Our platform is currently in the early stages of development. We have completed the frontend for the homepage, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing products and making purchases.

In the future, we plan to expand the platform to include a full-fledged admin system. This admin system will allow users to:

- Add, edit, and remove products
- Manage product categories and tags
- Upload and manage product images
- Track sales and revenue
- Manage user accounts and permissions
